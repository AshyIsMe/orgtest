#+title: Readme


* Issues

`@article`, `@thesis`, `@misc` citations all seem to work.
But `@phdthesis` citations do not work.

Messages shows this if i hit enter on the citation in doc.org:

#+begin_quote
org-cite-basic-goto: Cannot find citation key: "smith_2022"
#+end_quote

And that citation does not get rendered out to pdf.
